                <li>Push vegetables to one side of the skillet, add the eggs to the other side, and cook to scramble, stirring as necessary.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken, rice, evenly drizzle with soy sauce, optional salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook for about 2 minutes, or until chicken is reheated through.</li>
