        <ul>
            <p><em>For the dough</em></p>
            <li>4 cups bread flour, plus more kneading</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablepoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/2 kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
            <li>Cooking Spray</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <p><em>For the wath bath</em></p>
        <li>8 cups (2 quarts) water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup topping,such as everything bagel seasing, poppy seeds, or sesame seeds (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure out the dough ingredients. Place 4 cups bread flour, 1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar, and 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. (Alternatively, place in a large bowl if mixing by hand.) Whisk to combine. Stir 1 tablespoon active dry yeast into 1 1/2 cups warm water until dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>Mix the dough. With the mixer on the lowest speed, slowly pour in the water-yeast mixture and continue mixing until the dough forms a tight ball and the sides of the bowl are clean, about 8 minutes total. (If kneading by hand, slowly pour in the water while mixing with a wooden spoon. Transfer the dough to a clean work surface and knead by hand until a tight ball forms, 6 to 8 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Let the dough rise. Remove the dough from the bowl. Coat the bowl with cooking spray. Place the dough back in the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place until puffy and doubled in volume, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into balls. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and coat with cooking spray. Transfer the dough onto a clean work surface and divide into 12 pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a smooth, round ball.</li>
        <li>Let the dough balls rise. Place 6 on each baking sheet, spacing them at least 2 inches apart. Spray the tops of the balls with cooking spray, loosely cover with plastic wrap, and let them rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven and prepare a water bath. Arrange 2 racks to divide the oven into thirds and heat the oven to 425Â°F.</li>
        <li>Prepare a water bath. Place 8 cups water, 3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar, 1 teaspoon baking soda, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt in a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium to maintain a gentle simmer.</li>
        <li>Shape the bagels. Poke a hole through the center of each dough ball with your finger, then gently stretch the center by twirling it around your fingers until the hole is 1 inch in diameter.</li>
        <li>Boil the bagels. Carefully transfer 4 of the bagels into the simmering water. Simmer for 3 minutes. Flip the bagels with tongs and simmer for 2 minutes more. Remove the bagels from the water bath, hold them over the pot for a minute to drain off excess water, and place back onto the baking sheet. Immediately sprinkle each bagel with 2 teaspoons topping if desired. Repeat with the remaining bagels, making sure the water comes back up to a simmer between each batch.</li>
        <li>Bake the bagels. Bake the bagels for 12 minutes. Flip the bagels so that they are bottom-side up (this helps them maintain their shape). Bake until they are deep golden-brown, 8 to 12 minutes more. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
