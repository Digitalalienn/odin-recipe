    or as a entree. The dish is hearty and filling and ideal for those cool winter evenings.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200 g/7 oz bread for dumplings (small cubes of dried white bread or crumbled white rolls</li>
        <li> 200 ml / 3/4 cup milk </li>
        <li>100-150 g / 3 1/2 - 5 cups of smoked ham and/or spicy sausage (cured sausage etc)</li>
        <li> 3 eggs</li>
        <li> 2 shallots or 1 small onion</li>
        <li>Butter or sweating onions</li>
        <li> 2 tbsp freshly chopped parsley</li>
        <li> 2 - 3 tbsp flour</li>
        <li> Salt, Pepper, pinch of nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>Finely chop the shallots, and dice the smoked ham or sausage into small cubes. Heat some butter or clarified butter in a pan and sweat the onions in it until translucent. Add the meat and the parsley and fry together briefly, before removing from the heat.</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>Place the bread in a bowl. Beat the milk with the eggs and season well with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Pour over the bread. Stir in the sausage and onion paste and mix in the flour. Mix together to form a relatively firm paste (adding more bread or flour if necessary) and season again according to taste. Smooth the surface of the dough out and leave to stand for approx. 30 minutes.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>Heat up a good quantity of salted water in a large pan. Use the paste to form smaller dumplings (for use as a garnish in soups) or medium-sized dumplings, as required. Moisten the hands regularly with cold water during this stage, so that the dumplings take on smooth forms.</p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
            <p>Place into the boiling water, bring back to the boil and then turn down the heat and allow to simmer gently for around 8-20 minutes, depending on the size.</p>
        <li>Step 5</li>
            <p>Remove from the water, dry off well and serve up garnished with chopped parsley and melted butter (which has been taken on a nut-brown colour).
                Small shaped Tirol dumplings are often served as a garnish in strong, hot beef broth, while the bigger dumplings are served with warm sauerkraut or salad.</p>
